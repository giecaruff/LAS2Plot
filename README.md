# VisLas

A logplot generator from a Log ASCII Standard (LAS) 2.0 file
  
The logplot chart is an important data visualization type when working with well logs. The `main.py` program requires a LOG ASCII Standard (LAS) 2.0 file and a template file to create the plot.

## Dependencies

This program only has two dependencies:

- `yaml`
- `matplotlib`

It was developed and tested using:

- `Python 3.7.11`
- `yaml 5.4.1`
- `matplotlib 3.4.2`

## Usage

Before running `main.py` it is important to create the template file and set up the `config.json` file.

### 1 - Creating the template file

### 2 - Setting up the `config.json` file
